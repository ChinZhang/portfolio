        <p>Since I have just started to learn how to build applications, I do not have much projects but my
            my understanding has definitely expanded after taking web development and I am excited to build more
            full-stack projects with my understanding of how the web works and how applications are deployed.
            I have so many ideas like building a personal website for my interests for art and photography
            and I also want to build a efficient art topic or character randomizer website or app.</p>
